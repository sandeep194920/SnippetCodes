### What's this repo about?

This repo contains snippet codes that comes in handy while developing complex stuff. I would have played around with some stuff and might have achieved something which can be later reused in the projects.

Each folder inside src represents what the snippet is all about. Each folder inside the src also has a readme file that helps to understand the code.

Every folder inside src will have an index.js which can be imported into App.js and tested.
